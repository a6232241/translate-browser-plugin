# Conventional Commits Guidelines

This skill provides guidelines for creating Conventional Commits messages.

## Core Rules

1.  **Format**:
    - Use the format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
    - Types:
      - `feat`: New feature
      - `fix`: Bug fix
      - `docs`: Documentation only
      - `style`: Formatting, no code change
      - `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
      - `perf`: Performance improvement
      - `test`: Adding or updating tests
      - `chore`: Maintenance tasks

2.  **Scope**:
    - Keep subjects under 50 chars.
    - Use platform prefixes in scope if applicable: `fix(android): ...` or `feat(ios): ...`.

3.  **Language**:
    - Responses and commit messages must be in **Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)**.

4.  **User Input Priority**:
    - If the user provides specific text or a description in their request (e.g., `create commit "TEST: just TEST"`), this user-provided text **MUST** appear at the very beginning of the commit message, verbatim.
    - The AI-generated Conventional Commit message should follow on a new line.
    - **Example**:
      - User Input: `create commit "TEST: just TEST"`
      - Result:
        ```
        TEST: just TEST
        feat(scope): ai generated commit message...
        ```

5.  **Staged Changes Only**:
    - **CRITICAL**: Only generate commit messages based on **staged changes** (detected via `git diff --cached`).
    - **IGNORE** any unstaged changes in the working directory when generating the message.
    - **NEVER** automatically stage unstaged files unless explicitly requested by the user.
    - **NEVER** commit unstaged files.

## Workflow

1.  Run `git diff --cached` to analyze **staged** changes.
2.  Determine the type and scope.
3.  Draft the message in Traditional Chinese.
4.  Ensure it follows the `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` format.
